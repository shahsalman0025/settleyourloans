                        Dealing with debt can have a significant impact on your
                        mental and emotional well-being. It can lead to feelings
                        of hopelessness, anxiety, and depression, making it
                        difficult to concentrate on other important aspects of
                        your life, such as work or relationships. Moreover, the
                        constant pressure of being in debt can strain your
                        personal relationships, leading to further stress and
                        isolation.
